# Disease Detectives Event Overview

## Introduction
Disease Detectives is a Science Olympiad event that tests students' epidemiological abilities, that is, their skills in investigating, understanding, and discussing health conditions or diseases that affect many people.

This event spans across various disciplines including biology, environmental science, and social science, focusing on the principles of public health, diseases, and disease prevention.

## Event Topics
The Disease Detectives event revolves around multiple aspects of epidemiology:

- Infectious Diseases
- Non-Infectious Diseases
- Foodborne Illnesses
- Population Growth
- Environmental Quality
- Global Health

## Event Format
The event usually consists of a written test, containing a series of questions related to disease outbreak scenarios. The questions can range from multiple-choice, true/false, fill in the blanks, short answer, and occasionally, calculations.

## Event Objectives
The participants are expected to:

- Understand and interpret epidemiological data
- Identify types and characteristics of diseases
- Understand modes of transmission, risk factors, and prevention methods
- Apply mathematical skills for calculating disease rates and ratios
- Investigate and control disease outbreaks

## Preparation Tips

- **Study Materials**: Use textbooks, online resources, and CDC resources for studying. The official Science Olympiad site also provides useful resources.
- **Practice**: Make use of practice tests and quizzes to better understand the format and type of questions asked.
- **Current Events**: Stay up-to-date with current health events, disease outbreaks, and public health concerns around the world.

## Detailed Study Approach
1. **Basic Concepts**: Understand the principles of public health, types of studies, and basic biostatistics.
2. **Diseases**: Learn about different types of diseases, their causes, symptoms, modes of transmission, treatments, and prevention measures.
3. **Outbreak Investigation**: Understand the steps involved in an outbreak investigation.
4. **Data Analysis**: Learn to interpret and analyze epidemiological data, including graphs, tables, and statistical measures.
5. **Ethics**: Study the ethical considerations involved in public health decisions.
6. **Practice Scenarios**: Use real-world disease outbreak scenarios for practice.

## Conclusion
The Disease Detectives event challenges students to apply scientific and mathematical principles to real-world health issues. Proper preparation and practice can enable participants to perform well in this event and also gain valuable insights into the field of epidemiology.
