Time‚Äôs article on the ‚Äú Questions to. Fall in. Love‚Äù and the classic board-game. Sequence, this digital board game ‚Äì Table for. Four ‚Äì is built for sparking deeper conversations and creating meaningful connections. Similar to. Sequence, the motive of the game is to create -token sequences across the board with your assigned team-member. The catch: we‚Äôve replaced the deck of cards with a deck of meaningful questions that you have to answer in order to proceed! While the end-goal may be competitive, the beauty in this game is the journey to get there ‚Äì The more detailed your answer, the more follow-ups; the more follow-ups, the more chances for other players to share their answers too; and the more sharing, the greater the conversation. We also wanted to make sure this game could apply to anyone! From college friends to distant family, we‚Äôve got a version for all types of company you might keep. The current version available is called "Recess," which is built specifically for friends of all ages. Other versions we hope to work on soon are: "No. Strings. Attached" for not super personal but still interesting conversations; "Dinner. Table" for family-friendly / family-focused bonding time; "Cupid‚Äôs. Arrows" for couples; and "Saturday. Nights" as our +/party-setting deck. Yashvi. Jaju. CS, Business, Philosophy at. USC | Kleiner. Perkins. Fellow | Incoming. SWE. Intern at. Two. Sigma | President at. TroyLabs | Previously at. Slack.
