# Write It Do It Event Overview

## Introduction
Write It Do It is an engaging event in the Science Olympiad competition that tests students' writing and comprehension skills. This event involves one team member writing a description of a contraption and the other attempting to recreate it using the written instructions.

## Event Format
The event is split into two components:

- **Writing**: The writer is given a structure or contraption and must write a detailed set of instructions on how to recreate it.
- **Doing**: The doer, having not seen the original structure, follows the writer's instructions to recreate the structure as accurately as possible.

## Event Objectives
Participants are expected to:

- Communicate effectively through writing.
- Understand and follow written instructions.
- Work collaboratively with their teammate.
- Solve problems and think critically.

## Preparation Tips

- **Practice**: Regular practice with your teammate is crucial to understand each other's communication style and improve efficiency.
- **Terminology**: Develop a shared terminology or set of abbreviations to make communication more effective.
- **Analysis**: Analyze previous attempts and identify areas for improvement.
- **Time Management**: Learn to manage your time effectively, especially for the doer, as their time to recreate the structure is limited.

## Detailed Study Approach
1. **Understand the Basics**: Learn the basic principles of effective communication, especially in writing.
2. **Practice Writing and Building**: Regularly practice writing instructions and building structures.
3. **Feedback Loop**: Regular feedback from your teammate can help improve both the writing and doing parts.
4. **Mock Events**: Participate in mock Write It Do It events to get a feel for the real competition.

## Conclusion
The Write It Do It event is a unique and challenging event that tests a different set of skills than many other Science Olympiad events. It requires effective communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and time management. With the right preparation and practice, participants can excel in this event.
