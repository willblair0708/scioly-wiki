# About MYSO

The Modern Youth Science Olympiad (MYSO) initiative was born out of a necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional educational methods faced unprecedented challenges. With schools disrupted and competitions halted, there was an urgent need for a platform that could provide uninterrupted access to quality science education. MYSO emerged as a beacon, offering online education, mentorship, and a unique blend of study, lab, and build events for Science Olympiad enthusiasts. Going beyond the competition, MYSO is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the scientific community, aiming to provide equitable access to STEM education for all students.

## Our Vision

In a rapidly evolving world, the importance of science education cannot be overstated. Yet, numerous students across the globe find themselves without the means or resources to delve into the wonders of science. MYSO's vision is to bridge this gap. We aim to democratize access to quality science education, ensuring that every student, irrespective of their socio-economic background, geographical location, or educational institution, has an equal shot at exploring, learning, and excelling in the realm of Science Olympiad.

## Our Mission

At the heart of MYSO lies a set of core objectives that drive every decision, course, and program we offer:

- **Universal Accessibility:** We believe in a world where quality science education is not a privilege but a right. Our platform, resources, and courses are designed to be universally accessible, breaking down traditional barriers of cost and location.
  
- **Student-Driven Content:** Every course on MYSO is crafted with care, attention, and most importantly, insight from students who've walked the path. This ensures content that's not only academically sound but also engaging and relevant.
