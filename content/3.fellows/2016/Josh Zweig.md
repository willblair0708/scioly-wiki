They did not adequately inform me of financial aid coverage, denied to offer me financial assistance for extreme extenuating circumstances that they had offered other scholars, and redirected me to 'mentorship resources' as a 'substitute' for financial aid.

Adobe & IEEE are incredibly uncooperative, will acknowledge your extenuating circumstances, and then refuse contact with you for an entire month. Their staff was incredibly rude and dismissive in our exchanges, and the program faced several employee turnovers in a span of two years—if that is any additional indicator.
