About

Jeff. Grimes. Creating the future of news & information | Co-Founder of. Shades personal. I believe that almost all of us have an unhealthy information diet. We get our daily information from clickbaity newsfeeds, social media echo chambers, and mindless-scroll products riddled with low-nutrient content. Depending on professional journalists isn't much better -- they're subject to corporate bias and political agendas, they make the news boring by focusing only on "headline-worthy" issues, and their final product is a wall of text that busy people skim rather than read thoroughly. Our children spend hours a day browsing videos on. TikTok, whose parent company openly sends user data to the. Chinese government -- a clear national security threat that few people seem to be sufficiently concerned about. But unlike the traditional media cycle, it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom for our society. At. Shades, we're building a product that provides a healthy information diet, while still being entertaining and fun: - You see quick summaries of multiple points of view -- fast, comprehensive, and balanced. - You see a wide variety of topics, from cultural trends to politics to sports to movies to science. - You can share your own takes and opinions, and see how they evolve over time. You should follow my. LinkedIn page here if you're interested in boosting your own information diet, or that of your children. I post about the future of news and information -- the problems with the current options, and how we can fix them.
